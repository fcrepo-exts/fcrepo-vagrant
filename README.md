    * Manager username = "fedora4", password = "fedora4"
  * [Fedora 4.x](http://fedora.info/about) at [http://localhost:8080/fcrepo](http://localhost:8080/fcrepo)
    * No authentication configured

    * Installed in "/etc/fuseki"
    * Dataset Path name "/test"
    * Persistent storage "/etc/fuseki/databases/test\_data"
  * [Fcrepo-camel-toolbox 4.x](https://github.com/fcrepo4-exts/fcrepo-camel-toolbox)
    * Installed in Tomcat container

###Usage

* Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
* Clone this repository 
* `cd fcrepo4-vagrant`
* (optional) to enable role-based access control, edit `install_scripts/config` and change the `FEDORA_AUTH` variable to true.
  This will enable three accounts:
  * user account `testuser`, with password `password1`
  * user account `adminuser`, with password `password2`
  * admin account `fedoraAdmin` with the password `secret3`
* (optional) to enable fedora internal audit capability, edit `install_scripts/config` and change the FEDORA_AUDIT variable to true. The FEDORA_AUDIT_LOCATION can also be changed from its default "/audit", if necessary.
* `vagrant up`

## Support

If you receive the following error:
```
There are errors in the configuration of this machine, Please fix the following errors and try again:

vm:
* The box 'ubuntu/trusty64' could not be found.
```

Edit the file **Vagrantfile**, find the lines:
```
# Below needed for Vagrant versions < 1.6.x
# config.vm.box_url = "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box"
```
and un-comment the **config.vm.box\_url** line, save the file and retry.

#### Port 9080 (reindexing service) unavailable after vagrant up

It might happen that during the first `vagrant up` the reindexing service is not installed and the port 9080 is inaccessible (try `telnet localhost 9080`). To fix this run `vagrant provision` and check again. If it still does not work, install the services manually:
```
vagrant ssh
cd /opt/karaf/bin
./client </vagrant/install_scripts/fedora_camel_toolbox.script
```

## Windows Troubleshooting

If you receive errors involving `\r` (end of line):

Edit the global `.gitconfig` file, find the line:
```
autocrlf = true
```
and change it to
```
autocrlf = false
```
Remove and clone again. This will prevent windows git clients from automatically replacing unix line endings LF with windows line endings CRLF.
