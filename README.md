There are errors in the configuration of this machine, Please fix the following errors and try again:

vm:
* The box 'ubuntu/trusty64' could not be found.
```

Edit the file **Vagrantfile**, find the lines:
```
# Below needed for Vagrant versions < 1.6.x
# config.vm.box_url = "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box"
```
and un-comment the **config.vm.box\_url** line, save the file and retry.

This VM setup was heavily influenced (read: stolen) from [Islandora 2.x VM](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/tree/7.x-2.x/install).
